    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>I'm introducing to you all the showcase puppies that we are proud to call our own!</p>
       <ul>
         <li>They are the most loyal</li>
         <li>They are fun-loving</li>
         <li>They are very sweet</li>
      <p>These were the three characteristics I can sum up for these pups. Quite of few people have asked me what type of characteristics these puppies tend to have and I would need your help since I'm pretty biased.</p>
      <p>Below I have set up a short survey for you to fill out that will help people understand more about puppies.</p>

    <!--I couldn't find anything close to what my website was tyring to create since I wasn't being creative and my goal seemed to be nonexisting.
    The link above I thought was the closest to my webpage since I was trying to create a blog essentially to tell me more about their dogs if they have the types I've given on the option.
    I defintely recognize the basic HTML that all html start with.  there are a lot more elements use that I'm not sure what they do and it looks like it's a combination of css, html, and javascript.
    I see a few script elements and I belive they may be changing the code to use javascript? Not 100% sure.
    I think I was able to get to create a simple survey for users to input.  The webpage definitely was able to gear towards more specific responses. The website has more details than I and it seems a bit confusing since I dont recognize what more than half of it means.-->
